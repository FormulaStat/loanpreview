    <h2>GlobalStoxfx Loan Terms & Conditions</h2>
    <p>These Terms and Conditions (“Agreement”) govern the loan services offered by GlobalStoxfx (“Company”, “we”, “us”, “our”) to clients (“Borrower”, “you”, “your”). By applying for and accepting a loan from GlobalStoxfx, you agree to the following:</p>

    </ul>

    <h3>3. Interest Rate</h3>
    <p>All loans are issued at a fixed interest rate of 3% per annum, applied to the outstanding principal balance.</p>

    <h3>4. Repayment Terms</h3>
    <p>Loan tenure ranges from 24 months (2 years) up to 120 months (10 years). Borrower enjoys a 3-month moratorium period before repayments begin.</p>

    <p>Once the upfront fee is received in full, loan funds are disbursed within 24 hours to the Borrower’s designated account.</p>

    <h3>7. Collateral & Security</h3>
    <p>No physical collateral is required. The upfront fee serves as insurance-backed risk coverage.</p>

    <h3>8. Late Payment & Default</h3>
