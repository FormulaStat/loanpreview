        <li><strong>Repayment Terms</strong><br>
          Loan tenure ranges from 24 months (2 years) up to 120 months (10 years) depending on the approved facility. Borrower enjoys a 3-month moratorium period (no repayment required for the first 3 months). Repayments are due monthly thereafter until full settlement of principal and interest.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Upfront Fee Requirement</strong><br>
          An upfront fee equal to 5% of the total loan amount is required prior to disbursement. This fee is credited into the Borrower’s GlobalStoxfx account wallet for processing and must be paid before loan release. The fee covers: processing and administrative costs and insurance policy coverage, as the loan is collateral-free. This fee is non-refundable under all circumstances.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Loan Disbursement</strong><br>
          Once the upfront fee is received in full, loan funds are disbursed within 24 hours to the Borrower’s designated account. Disbursement is subject to successful verification of application details and fee confirmation.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Collateral &amp; Security</strong><br>
